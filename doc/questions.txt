MSB vs. LSB
  * p.5: ... words are addressed by the location of their lowest numbered byte
  * p.47: prog 2.2: "LDA three" and storage directive "three WORD 3" ... seems as MSB
  * What is lowest numbered byte? Is this LSB?
  * Decision: We use MSB!

Register numbers
  * p.5: PC=8, SW=9 due to compatibility with XE
  * Why is number 7 unused?
  * Number 9=10001b does not fit into 4 bits, e.g., in instructions ADDR, ...
  * Better would be PC=7, SW=8

Multiple sections with the same name
  * Is this allowed?
  * No. Since, the CSECT format is: <section_name> CSECT and labels are unique.
  * However, the assembler could easily be extended to support section reentry.
  * Decision: by the book, no section reentry.

Addressing resolution
  * p.59
  * first try PC-relative, then base-relative
  * if neither is applicable programmer must use format 4 (extended)
  * So when direct/absolute addressing can be used? Only for absolute symbols?
  * Can we after PC-rel and base-rel have failed use direct? See also next point.

Direct/absolute addressing in format 3 and SIC format
  * Renders the code unrelocatable.
  * In particular, it is unrelocatable only in the range of 12 bit displacement.
  * Should we use this mode?

Immediate with negative operands
  * e.g., LDA #-1
  * use of direct/absolute addressing
  * however in simple and indirect operand gives the absolute address, thus it is unsigned
  * can in the case of immediate addressing the operand be signed.
  * Decision: the assembler treats immediate as signed, all other as unsigned

Directive ORG value
  * p.73: "value is a constant or an expression involving constants and previously defined symbols"
  * Can we use forward reference? At least to absolute symbols. Yes?
  * Thus, expressions consists of constants and symbols (absolute or (relative) previously defined)

Directive ORG and length of code?
  * How does one calculate code length if it contains ORG:
    * so there is a large non-assembled gap, or
    * there ORG address is before start address (we have negative code length)
  * See also p. 74 for a discussion on ORG (without parameter) used for resetting to the previous value.
  * Decision:
    * At the end of every section we implicitly issue ORG (reset the locctr).
    * Then we calculate the length.
    * Consequently, we ignore all the "ORG address" parts.
