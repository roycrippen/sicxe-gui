In the following:
  * five is absolute symbol (e.g., five EQU 5)
  * label is relative symbol (e.g., label FIX)

Immediate addressing
  * precedence order: signed absolute, pc, base
  * absolute (direct): signed 12-bit operand
    * LDA #5
    * LDA #-42
    * LDA #five
  * pc-relative: signed 12-bit displacement
    * LDA #label
  * base-relative: unsigned 12-bit displacement
    * LDA #label
  * absolute extended: unsigned 20-bit operand
    * +LDA #5
    * +LDA #five
    * +LDA #label

Indirect addressing
  * precedence order: pc, base, absolute
  * absolute (direct): unsigned 12-bit address
    * LDA @5
    * LDA @five
  * pc-relative: signed 12-bit displacement
    * LDA #label
  * base-relative: unsigned 12-bit displacement
    * LDA #label
  * absolute extended: unsigned 20-bit address
    * +LDA @5
    * +LDA @five
    * +LDA @label

Simple addressing
  * precedence order: pc, base, absolute, sic absolute
  * absolute (direct): unsigned 12-bit address
    * LDA 5
    * LDA five
  * pc-relative: signed 12-bit displacement
    * LDA #label
  * base-relative: unsigned 12-bit displacement
    * LDA #label
  * sic absolute: unsigned 15 bit address
    * LDA 5
    * LDA five
    * LDA label
    * program becomes unrelocatable
  * absolute extended: unsigned 20-bit address
    * +LDA 5
    * +LDA label
  * all modes can be combined with indexed addressing
