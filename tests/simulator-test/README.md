## Running the Makefile
Makefile is used for generating reference obj files from asm examples in the `src` folder.

1. Copy the compiled `sictools.jar` in this folder.
2. Run `make build`.

The reference obj files are put in the obj folder.

## Running generator.sh
The `generator.sh` script generates the ref files that are used for diff in the `tester.sh` script.

Reference program is defined in the PROG variable.
Reference program should support:
- Accepting obj as an input file
- Dumping all of the registers: `A,X,L,B,S,T,F` with their final values at the start of dump file.
- Dumping the memory in specified range; `$PROG -m$from,$len obj/${BASE}.obj` where $PROG is command to run reference program, $from is the start of memory to dump, $len is the length of memory to dump
- The output should be put in a file called `dump`.

## Running tester.sh
`tester.sh` is used for testing the output of your program vs. the output of the .ref files.

Your program is defined in the PROG variable.
The script will similarly to the `generator.sh` script and compare the result of your files with the ref folder.
It will also report errors in case your program exits with error code.

The testing scripts and tests are made by Tadej Borov≈°ak.


_TODO_: Fix the `float.asm` test, it is currently commented since it produces an error while assembling it with sictools.
