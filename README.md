# sicxe-tools

Clone of [SicTools](https://github.com/jurem/SicTools.git) with Maven build and enhancements <br><br>
Tools for SIC/XE hypothetical computer from the Leland Beck's book System Software. Includes:
  * Assembler
  * Simulator
  * Linker

## Assembler
Assembler supports all instructions and directives described in the book. This includes load/store instructions, arithmetic instructions, jumps etc. And directives START, END, ORG, LTORG, BASE, NOBASE, CSECT, USE, EQU, RESB, RESW, EXTDEF, EXTREF. Some features:
  * immediate addressing, indirect addressing, simple addressing
  * PC-relative addressing, base addressing (BASE and NOBASE directive), indexed addressing
  * standard directives START, END, ORG
  * support for literals, LTORG directive
  * support for EQU expressions, full forward and backward references resolved via the algorithm described in the book
  * support for sections via CSECT directive
  * support for blocks via USE directive
  * assembler syntax is (see command line options) more flexbile and free than original
  * floating-point syntax extensions (FLOT and RESF directives)
  * syntax extension for specifying numbers in binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal format
  * generates debugging-friendly listing file showing original source and corresponding address and generated code
  * generates log file showing code statistics, list of blocks, list of sections, list of symbols, list of literals, list of relocations
  * and more

## Simulator
Simulator is user-friendly GUI based application that loads asm or obj files. Features:
  * CPU view of registers and current instructions, shows changed registers in different color, supports changing registers values
  * disassembly view with breakpoints and data breakpoints
  * memory view with full edit support in hexadecimal and character mode
  * watch view with symbols from assembly file
  * textual screen support
  * devices 0, 1, 2 are redirected to standard input, output and error
  * detected pseudo HALT instruction (jump on itself)
  * automatic execution with set speed (from 1 Hz to 1 MHz)
  * keyboard input
  * and more

## Linker
Linker supports linking .obj files produced by the assembler into one. Each object file can have multiple control sections and needs to be relative. Other features include:
  * a graphical interface for selecting .obj files and choosing the linker settings
  * inspecting, editing and reordering control sections or symbols in a gui or textual interface
  * partial linking when some of the references are not present
  * option to keep symbols in the output file to allow further linking
  * and more

Installation
------------

SicTools may be downloaded as a JAR file or built from source.

### JAR
Download the latest stable version from [releases](https://github.com/jurem/SicTools/releases). You may need to change the file permissions to allow execution.

### Building from source
Download / clone source code and run make.

    git clone https://github.com/jurem/SicTools.git
    cd SicTools
    make jar
    
Usage
-----

To run simulator

    java -jar out/make/sictools.jar

To run assembler

    java -cp out/make/sictools.jar sic.Asm source.asm

where `source.asm` is the file to be compiled.

To get assembler help

    java -cp out/make/sictools.jar sic.Asm -help

To run linker

    java -cp out/make/sictools.jar sic.Link -o out.obj in1.obj in2.obj ...

where `out.obj` is the output file and `in1.obj`, `in2.obj`,... are .obj files to be linked.

To get linker help

    java -cp out/make/sictools.jar sic.Link -help

To get graphical linker interface

    java -cp out/make/sictools.jar sic.Link -g
